Example set for the [beginner ticdat](https://github.com/ticdat/ticdat/wiki/1-Beginner-ticdat-intro) wiki pages.

* initial_example - Companion to [this](https://github.com/ticdat/ticdat/wiki/3-Beginner-ticdat-initial-example). 
Each file here links to the original Gurobi example page that inspired it.
* command_line_example - extends initial_example/diet.py to have command line functionality, and thus remove
the need for satellite files. Also provides a small hard coded data file in json format. 

You'll need to install `gurobipy` and get a temporary license to use these examples. They are generally
pretty nice about giving a temporarly license, and the [download](https://www.gurobi.com/downloads/) is 
unrestricted.
