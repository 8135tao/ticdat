# opalytics-ticdat

## zombie

this branch was merged. it implemented the functionality to allow pickling (indirectly, but still) of ticDat objects.

Why do we need to pickle? Because, AFAIK, you can't multiproccess with pickling, as mp uses pipes.

## PJC is ok with Aaron killing this zombie. headstrike!!
