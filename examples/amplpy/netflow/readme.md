### NB

The input data set here is different than the gurobipy input set. Not sure why I set it up that way, 
and its not really a problem per se, just putting a reminder here in case someone is wondering why the
results are not the same as the gurobipy results. When I point this solver at the gurobipy input set, 
it gives the same results.
