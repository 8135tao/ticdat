Repository for amplpy examples.

These examples use `PanDatFactory` to connect `amplpy` seamlessly with `pandas`. This is our recommended best practice for OR practitioners looking to combine optimization with Python.

 * diet - standard diet example. Easiest example.
 * netflow - standard multi-commodity network flow problem. Second easiest example.
 * fantop - fantasy football example. See [here](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/fantasy-footballers-nerds-too-peter-cacioppi/) for more information. This is a good example of using `pandas` for pre and post solve data munging.
 * metrorail - optimize the number of times you visit the fare kiosk when riding the metro. See [here](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/miami-metrorail-meets-python-peter-cacioppi/) for more information. This is a good example of constructing a comprehensive solution from a series of sub-problems.
 * simplest_examples - examples shrunk down by removing the data integrity checking functionality.
