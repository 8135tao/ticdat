This directory contains examples shrunk down by removing the data integrity checking functionality. 
Industrial engines are much improved by using this functionality, and I don't recommend skipping pre-condition 
checking for your engines. That said, most Python-MIP example codes don't include pre-condition checking of the 
input data, and for this reason I made comparable example codes to facilitate apples-to-apples comparisons.
